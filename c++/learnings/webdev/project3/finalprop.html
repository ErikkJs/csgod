The name of my website is goat squad motorsport. The website will be an ecommerce website where users will be able to login/register and order performance parts for sports cars. The website targets people who are into the car performace scene and own cars that are of sporty variety. The homepage will have an image carusel as well as the links on the nav for the user to move along the website. The website will be built on bootstrap using Php as the heart that pumps the blood. Visitors will be able to buy the performance parts they need as well as see the Hp gains that each item will provide the vehicle. the website will have a home,products,shoppingcart,contactus,login,logout,register, and a admin page. Each page will do as they are called and the admin page will allow the owner of the website to add/drop products. The webpage will have 2 tables, users and products. ( the page might split the tables in order to make joins for the sorting like make and model to certain parts based on foregin keys) the theme is still under works but it will be black and white with red. the page will have a nav bar at the top of the page courtesy of bootstrap. this website is very similar to almost every ecommerce store out there that sells car parts, it will be diffrent in the sense that it will only have one developer who is by far superior to the rest.
