/* This code is derived from the CMPS 376 networking code by Marc Thomas
 *
 * The purpose of this code is to create a very simple Internet server which
 * binds to a port, does a simple handshake with the client and then echos 
 * everything the client sends to the screen.
 *
 * Command line usage:
 *   $ vcrec [packet_size] &
 *
 *   if packet_size is specified, it must be a positive integer and only that
 *   many bytes will be read from the client.
 *
 * TCP/IP socket functions used by this program:
 * 
 *   socket()        Create a byte stream for client connection requests
 *   bind()          Bind the socket to IP address and request TCP port number
 *   getsockname()   Query what port number the system assigned to the process
 *   listen()        Wait for a client to issue a connection request
 *   accept()        Accept the connection request from a client
 *   send()          Send data to the client
 *   recv()          Receive data from the client
 *   close()         Close the sockets
 *
 * Connection process:
 *
 * vcsend                      vcrec
 * -------------------------   ------------------------- 
 *  
 * socket() (client socket)    socket() (listen socket)
 *                             bind()
 *                             getsockname()
 *                             listen()
 * connect() --------------->  accept() (creates 2nd data socket)
 *
 * (data exchange phase can be response-driven but if more
 *  than one descriptor must be managed use of select() is
 *  strongly recommended)
 * 
 * send() --------------------> recv()
 * recv() <-------------------- send()
 * 
 * close() (client socket)     close() (both data and listen socket)
